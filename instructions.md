# Master Prompt — Full-Stack E-Commerce Website Generation
> Copy and paste this entire prompt into your AI IDE. It is structured in sections so the AI
treats each area with equal priority.
---
## THE PROMPT
```
You are building a production-grade, fully functional e-commerce platform. The tech stack is
strictly: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Supabase (Auth
+ Database + Storage), and Razorpay for payments. The project must be deployable to
Vercel with zero configuration issues.
This is NOT a template or mockup. Every feature must be wired to Supabase and fully
functional.
---
## SECTION 1 — UI DESIGN SYSTEM (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
The UI must look like it was designed by a top-tier design agency (think: Apple Store,
Rapha, Aesop, Mr Porter). Follow these rules with zero exceptions:
### Typography
- Use Inter for body text and a premium serif font (Playfair Display or DM Serif Display) for
hero headings and product titles.
- Font sizes: Hero headings 56–72px, Section headings 36–44px, Product titles 18–22px,
Body text 15–16px, Captions/labels 12–13px in uppercase tracked-out (letter-spacing:
0.1em).
- Line height: 1.2 for headings, 1.6 for body text. Never use default line heights.
### Color Palette
- Primary background: #FAFAFA (warm off-white). Secondary background: #F5F5F0
(cream).
- Primary text: #1A1A1A. Secondary text: #6B6B6B.
- Accent color: #2563EB (deep blue) — used only for CTAs, links, and active states.
- Destructive/sale: #DC2626. Success: #16A34A.
- All cards and containers must use background #FFFFFF with a subtle border (border: 1px
solid rgba(0,0,0,0.06)) and a refined shadow (shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0 4px
12px rgba(0,0,0,0.03)).
### Spacing & Layout
- Use an 8px grid system. All padding, margins, and gaps must be multiples of 8 (8, 16, 24,
32, 48, 64, 80, 120).
- Maximum content width: 1440px, centered. Horizontal page padding: 64px on desktop,
24px on mobile.

- Section vertical padding: 80–120px. Never less than 64px between major sections.
- Product grid: 4 columns on desktop, 2 on mobile. Grid gap: 24px. No masonry layouts.
### Micro-Interactions & Animations (Framer Motion)
Every interaction must feel tactile and premium. Implement all of the following:
1. **Page transitions**: Wrap the entire app in AnimatePresence. Pages fade in (opacity
0→1) and slide up (y: 20→0) over 0.4s with ease [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1].
2. **Product card hover**: On hover, the product image scales to 1.05 over 0.5s with
cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1). A secondary lifestyle image crossfades in (opacity swap). The
"Quick Add" button slides up from below the card (y: 20→0, opacity 0→1) with a staggered
0.1s delay.
3. **Add-to-cart effect**: When a user clicks "Add to Cart", animate a ghost image of the
product (position: fixed, cloned from the product image) that flies in a bezier arc toward the
cart icon in the header. The ghost image should scale from 1→0.2, rotate slightly (rotate:
10deg), and fade out at the end. Simultaneously, the cart icon should do a spring bounce
(scale 1→1.3→1, type: "spring", stiffness: 400). A small "+1" badge should pop in with a
scale animation. Use Framer Motion's useAnimation controller for this orchestration.
4. **Button interactions**: All buttons scale to 0.97 on press (whileTap), have a 0.2s
background-color transition on hover. Primary CTA buttons have a subtle shimmer/gradient
sweep animation on hover (background-position shift on a linear-gradient).
5. **Scroll-triggered reveals**: Every section, product card, and text block should animate in
on scroll using Framer Motion's whileInView. Use staggerChildren: 0.08 for grid items.
Animation: fade up (opacity 0→1, y: 30→0) over 0.6s.
6. **Cart drawer**: Opens from the right as a slide-over panel (x: 100%→0) with a backdrop
blur overlay that fades in. Cart items inside stagger in (staggerChildren: 0.05). Removing an
item should animate it out (opacity→0, height→0, x→50) before removal.
7. **Image gallery on PDP**: Main image crossfades between selections (AnimatePresence
mode="wait"). Thumbnail click triggers a subtle scale pulse on the main image. Implement
pinch-to-zoom on mobile.
8. **Skeleton loading states**: Every dynamic content area must show animated skeleton
placeholders (shimmer gradient animation using CSS background-position) before data
loads. Never show blank space or layout shift.
9. **Toast notifications**: Slide in from top-right, auto-dismiss after 3s with a shrinking
progress bar at the bottom. Entrance: slide from right + fade. Exit: slide to right + fade.
10. **Navigation**: Sticky header that shrinks in height (80px→60px) on scroll with a subtle
backdrop-blur and bottom border that fades in. Mobile menu is a full-screen overlay that
fades in with staggered nav links animating from the left.
### Component Quality Rules
- All images must use next/image with proper aspect ratios, priority loading for above-fold,
and blur placeholders.
- Buttons must have visible focus-visible outlines (2px offset ring in accent color) for
accessibility.
- Inputs must have floating labels that animate up on focus (not placeholder text).
- Every clickable element must have cursor-pointer and a hover/active state.
- Mobile responsiveness is mandatory. Test every component at 375px, 768px, and 1440px
widths.

- Empty states must have illustrations and helpful CTAs (e.g., empty cart shows illustration +
"Continue Shopping" button).
- Use <motion.div> from Framer Motion, not CSS animations, for all animated UI. CSS
transitions are acceptable only for color/background changes.

### RLS Policies:
- Customers can only read/update their own profile, addresses, orders, reviews, and wishlist.
- Products, categories, and site settings are publicly readable.
- Only admins (role = 'admin') can insert/update/delete products, categories, orders,
coupons, settings, hero_slides, and media.
- Orders: customers can read their own; admins can read all.
- Reviews: publicly readable; customers can create for products they've ordered; admins can
delete.
### Storage Buckets:
- "product-images" — public read, admin write.
- "brand-assets" — public read, admin write (logos, favicons).
- "media-library" — public read, admin write.
- "avatars" — authenticated read/write own folder.
### Database Functions / Triggers:
- Auto-generate order_number on order insert (e.g., 'ORD-' || 10000 + id).
- Auto-update updated_at on row changes.
- Decrement product stock on order creation (if track_inventory = true).
- Recalculate coupon times_used on order creation with coupon.

(with flying animation trigger), removeItem, updateQuantity, clearCart, subtotal, itemCount.
- Auth state: Supabase auth listener in a context provider.
- No Redux or Zustand unless absolutely necessary. Keep it simple.
### Performance:
- Use Next.js dynamic imports for heavy components (rich text editor, charts).
- Implement ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for product pages (revalidate: 60).
- Lazy load below-fold images.
- Bundle size must stay under 200KB first-load JS.
### Deployment:
- Include vercel.json only if needed.
- All environment variables via .env.local: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY,
Razorpay_SECRET_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_Razorpay_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
Razorpay_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
- Include a .env.example file with all required variables listed.
- Include a README.md with setup instructions.
### Razorpay Integration:

- Create Payment Intent on the server (API route) when user initiates checkout.
- Use Razorpay Elements for card input on the frontend.
- Razorpay Webhook endpoint (/api/webhooks/Razorpay) to handle
payment_intent.succeeded → update order payment_status to 'paid'.
- Support for Razorpay Test Mode.

ProductCard, etc.) with all animations.
5. Build the storefront layout (Header with dynamic logo, Footer, CartDrawer).
6. Build the homepage with all sections.
7. Build PLP with filters and sorting.
8. Build PDP with all features.
9. Build cart + checkout + Razorpay integration.
10. Build user account pages.

Generate all code files with complete implementations. Do not use placeholder comments
like "// TODO" or "// implement later". Every function must be fully written.
```

## BONUS: UI REFERENCE KEYWORDS
If the AI needs extra nudging on design quality, append this at the end of the prompt:
```
VISUAL REFERENCE KEYWORDS FOR UI QUALITY:
The website should visually feel like a blend of these brands: Apple Store's minimalism and
whitespace, Aesop's typography and elegance, Nike's product page energy, Shopify Dawn
theme's clean structure. The admin panel should feel like a mix of Vercel's dashboard clarity
and Linear's polished UI. If in doubt about any design choice, choose the more minimal,
more spacious, more refined option. White space is a feature, not a bug.
